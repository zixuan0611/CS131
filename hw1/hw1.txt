My assessment for homework 1:

1. set oparation functions
I write the first five problems related to the set operations by applying the
math knowledge I learned in high school about sets.
Basically, they all use pattern matching according to their math definition.
I used recursion for the subset function and the set_union function.
The equal_sets function just needs to use subset function twice.
For the intersection and difference set opration, I used List.filter to
return all the satisfied elements in the list for convenience.
I used List.mem for all the set operations, but at first I intended to use
List.exists. I discarded the List.exists after I read the module and find mem.

2. computing fixed point of a function
This function is not that hard after I understand the definition of the 
fixed point. At first glance, I think the result is related to the period of 
function because the computation method involves f (f (f x))...

3. filter_reachable g
I consider this function the most difficult one for homework 1. Although I
understand the grammar and rules quickly since I am linguistics major, 
I did not know how to write the function. I carefully analyzed the process
and intended to write a big function at first. But later I divided the function
into several parts -- checked the symbol first, and then gradully constructed 
the reachable rules using recursion.
